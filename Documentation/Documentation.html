            <H3>What is Bitkal?</H3>

            <p>Bitkal is a programming language made for fun... nothing to special about it ._.</p>
            <p>but here is how to use it!</p>

            <H3>Compiling Bitkal</H3>

            <p>To compile bitkal simply run the Compiler.bat wich should compile Bitkal for you</p>

            <H3>Run Command</H3>

            <p>The run command just makes it that instead of having to write all your commands in the bitkal terminal</p>
            <p>you can just run files with bitkal code inside of them</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>For example make a file named whatever, in this example its named project, with the file extension .bk</p>

            <img src="images/file project.bk.png" width="50%" height="50%">

            <p>Afterwards we can write are code in it</p>

            <img src="images/code project.bk.png">

            <p>And then we can run this file by just writing in the terminal the command run("your_files_name.bk")</p>
            <p>note: this wont work if shell.exe and your project.bk are in different file directories</p>

            <img src="images/run project.bk.png">

            <H3>Print Command</H3>

            <p>To print simply do print("whatever you whant to print") you can also print variables by just removing the quotes</p>
